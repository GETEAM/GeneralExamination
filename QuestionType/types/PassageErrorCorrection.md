parts of the moon, put spaceships in orbit around another
planet and possibly within the decade will land into another 3._______
planet and explore it. Can we be too bold as to 4._______
suggest that we may be able to colonize other planet 5._______
within the not - too - distant future ? Some have advocated
such a procedure as a solution to the population
problem: ship the excess people off to the moon. But
we must keep in head the billions of dollars we might 6._______
spend in carrying out the project. To maintain the
earth's population at its present level. we would have
to blast off into space 7,500 people every hour of　every day of the year.
Why are we spending so little money on space 7._______
exploration ? Consider the great need for improving 8._______
many aspects of the global environment, one is surely
justified in his concern for the money and resources
