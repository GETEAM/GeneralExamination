#Reading True or False (阅读理解是非题)

##实际样题

Congress of Federated Organizations (COFO) brought more than a hundred college students, many from outside the state, to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 to join with local activists to register voters, teach in "Freedom Schools" and organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. The work was as dangerous as ever: three civil rights workers, James Chaney, a young black Mississippian and plasterer's apprentice, and two white volunteers, Andrew Goodman, a Queens Collegeanthropology student, and Michael Schwerner, a social worker from Manhattan's Lower East Side, were murdered by members of the Klan, some of them in the Neshoba County sheriff's department, on June 21, 1964.
The national uproar caused by their disappearance forced the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate, even though President Johnson had to use indirect threats of political reprisals (报复) against J. Edgar Hoover to force him to do so. After paying at least one participant in the crime for details about the murders, the FBI found their bodies on August 4 in an earthen dam outside Philadelphia, Mississippi. Schwerner and Goodman had been shot once; Chaney, the lone African-American, had been savagely beaten and shot three times. The FBI also discovered, in the course of its investigation, the bodies of a number of other Mississippi blacks whose disappearances had been reported over the past several years without attracting any attention outside their local communities.
The disappearance of these three activists remained in the public eye for the month and a half until their bodies were found. Johnson used the outrage over their deaths and his formidable political skills to bring about the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination in public accommodations, employment and education.

James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were all white volunteers.
