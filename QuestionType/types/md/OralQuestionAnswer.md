When look up the word “life” in the dictionary,   life means what we are experiencing during the time between birth and death, both physically and mentally. However, the meaning of life doesn’t only means this of course. Then I check online to see if there’s a proper answer to this question, but it turns out to be that life means everything.  <br>    In my opinion, life means these following 3 things: growth, love, happy.Firstly,I think life means growth.At every moment of my life, I may face different difficulties, sometimes I get through it and then move on,but sometimes I fail. I used to try my best to achieve all the goals I had set, to my surprise, failure taught me more than success. Every time after my failure, I will be stronger than before. Thus, I gradually grow from a little girl to a young lady, I think that’s the meaning of life. You can easily find everybody around you is growing with you, then, a new life and a new world. Secondly, I think life means love. There’s an old saying: Love is something, to be loved is nothing,love and to be loved are everything. I can’t imagine a person live on without love",
