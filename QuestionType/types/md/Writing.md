I was accepted to the college of your choice.” We can infer that the mom chooses college for her child, but should the parents make such decision for their children? As far as I concerned, parents can give advice for their children instead of making decisions for them. <br>Firstly, parents always want to give their children the best, however, they cannot completely understand their children’s interest and can’t sure what the most suitable is to their children. They just give their children what they consider the best, regardless of what their children want and what they like. So the best way to show your love is to respect children’s choice. Secondly, the children should responsible for their own life. Parents can company their children decades of years, but they cannot company their children’s whole life. Parents can give their children advice, but teach their children to be independent is more important in their growth. <br>To sum up, parents can give their children advice,but they should respect their children’s choice. After all, children will grow up one day, and they must learn how to live independent and be responsible for their own life.",
