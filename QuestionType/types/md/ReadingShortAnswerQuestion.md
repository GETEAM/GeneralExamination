##实际样题

One July mid-morning of 1997, Rosa Parks sat in an automobile awaiting a signal to appear before a large audience of admirers. A proud mother and her daughter stopped beside the car. "That's the lady we've come to see," the woman told her daughter. "What did she do," her daughter asked. "She refused to give up her seat for a white man," the mother replied. Puzzled, the child asked, "Why was that great?" Her mother never answered. I remember thinking that this young, Black girl, about 12, is a part of a generation of southern Blacks whose parents have never lived under segregation, Blacks to whom Rosa Parks' defiance makes no sense without an historical perspective. This new generation of Blacks requires an explanation: "Why has refusing to give up her seat to a white man made Rosa Parks a great Black woman?"  
Refusing to give up her seat made her great because--and only because-- her defiance was the specific act that led to the grass-roots social movement involving enough middle-class Blacks to eventually force the policy changes in Washington that ended second-class citizenship for millions of Blacks forever.  Her single act led to the Montgomery bus boycott, the emergence of Martin Luther King, Jr., The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and many other organizations, saints, and martyrs who fought against second-class citizenship for Blacks and "by piggy-back" for women. It led to black solidarity that never occurred before or since.  Her defiance in Montgomery was followed by Black defiance in Birmingham, Selma, and Memphis and sit-ins in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, and other states. Nevertheless, the civil rights movement of the 60s must be thought of as a continuous movement beginning as early as 1846, with Dred Scott, who sued his owner for his and his family's freedom. The civil rights movement has always been an attempt to overcome the decision in Dred Scott.

1. What did Rosa Parks once do? 

2. What makes him so tired? 

3. what shall we do?

5. Do you think Rosa is a good boy? why?
