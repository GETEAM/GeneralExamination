##实际样题

Global warming is a trend toward warmer conditions around the world. Part of the warming is natural; we have experienced a 20,000 -year -long warming as the last ice age ended and the ice ( 1 ) away. However, we have already reached temperatures that are in ( 2 ) with other minimum-ice periods, so continued warming is likely not natural. We are ( 3 ) to a predicted worldwide increase in temperatures ( 4 ) between 1℃ and 6℃ over the next 100 years. The warming will be more ( 5 ) in some areas, less in others, and some places may even cool off. Likewise, the ( 6 ) of this warming will be very different depending on where you are—coastal areas must worry about rising sea levels, while Siberia and northern Canada may become more habitable (宜居的) and ( 7 ) for humans than these areas are now.

The fact remains, however, that it will likely get warmer, on ( 8 ) , everywhere. Scientists are in general agreement that the warmer conditions we have been experiencing are at least in part the result of a human-induced global warming trend. Some scientists ( 9 ) that the changes we are seeing fall within the range of random (无规律的) variation—some years are cold, others warm, and we have just had an unremarkable string of warm years ( 10 ) —but that is becoming an increasingly rare interpretation in the face of continued and increasing warm conditions.
